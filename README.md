# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Objective

Creating interactive web pages that are dynamically updated using JavaScript, using different libraries that enhance the quality of the web apps.

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day (9am to 5pm timeframe) by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library needs to be used to work with date and time.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
 
## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* When  click on a timeblock, it adds an event and press Save.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
